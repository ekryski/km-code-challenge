Kiss Metrics Code Challenge
===========================

## Description

Feel free to use any JS frameworks/components of your choice.

1. I've put a sample data set here: https://gist.github.com/percyhanna/55dfd1feaab13d98c901
2. Create a sortable table that represents the dataset
3. Add an "Edit" button to each row that would allow a user to edit the row's data in separate form below the table
4. Clicking "Save" in the form would update the record in the table
